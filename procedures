1. Capture and Process Video Frames:
Use OpenCV to read the video file and extract frames. This involves iterating through each frame of the video to analyze the foot's position.
2. Detect Foot Position:
Implement a method to detect the foot's position in each frame. This could involve:
Color Detection: If the driverâ€™s shoes have a distinct color, you can use color thresholding to detect the foot.
Machine Learning Models: Train a model to recognize the foot and its position relative to the pedals.
The code snippet provided uses a placeholder function some_detection_function to determine foot position. You need to replace this with actual detection logic.
3. Identify Transitions:
Determine when the foot transitions from the gas pedal to the brake pedal. This can be done by setting thresholds for the foot's position on the y-axis, assuming different y-coordinates for gas and brake pedals.
4. Count and Record Transitions:
Keep track of each transition from gas to brake and vice versa. Store these transitions in a list or other data structure.
5. Calculate Frequency:
Once all frames are processed, calculate the frequency of transitions by counting the number of occurrences over the total duration of the video.
